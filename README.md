# Bronze-Age Network Graph (BANG) - Pre-Alpha 0.0a [Updated Nov 2023]

BANG will be an interactive tool used to display relationships of actors within bronze-age history. It consists of a visualisation generated using the NetworkX python library, with Nodes (actors), and Edges (Letters, Treatise, Trade), displaying the concept of globalisation prevalent in bronze-age history.

This project draws inspiration from Eric H. Cline's 2014 book *1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed*.

# Scope

The idea is to display information links regarding different important actors throughout bronze-age history using NetworkX. This graph may hopefully serve as a basis for an interactive front-end site, where users can over over different nodes and edges to display information about a particular node/link (ie. hovering a link between two actors shows all of the correspondence between the two actors).

# Project Phases

## Pre-alpha - Nov 2023

Phase will finish once the dataset has been completed, published, with a working minimal interactive front-end.

## Alpha - tba

## Beta - tba

## Release - tba

# Current epics/To-dos

Please see the issues page for up-to-date to-dos.

1. Identify file format to be ingested in NetworkX
2. Create and test dummy data in the correct format
