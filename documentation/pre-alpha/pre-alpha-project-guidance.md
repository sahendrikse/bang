# BANG PRE-ALPHA

BANG is currently in the 'PRE-ALPHA' state, currently forming a coherent direction of the project. This is to aid in the creation of pre-alpha tickets to be worked on.

## Deliverables:

1. A good data format to be ingested by NetworkX, which meets the requirements of the project.
2. The research into how an interactive UI may be implemented, if this is possible with NetworkX.
3. Identifying the basis of programming tasks to achieve project aims.
4. Housekeeping: Ensure the project board tickets are created and non-default tagging is implemented.

## Pre-alpha project aims:

1. An underlying, accurate, and detailed dataset which contains all the relevant information that we need.
2. An algorithm that ingests and displays this dataset.
3. The beginnings of research into how an interactive UI may be implemented.
